This is the game called "Simon says" built by using technologies of HTML , CSS and Javascript ! 

Here are the guidelines of playing it if you want : 

1. To start the game , press any key on your keyboard !
2. As soon as the game is started , a button of a random color will flash then you have to click that button .
3. After you press the correct button , a new button will flash , then you have to press the button you pressed previously and the button that just flashed
4. And if you fail to do so , the game will be over .

Well , this game was just made to showcase how we use technologies of html css and javascript to create amazing things but you can also have fun playing it which also tests you memory !

Now let me say goodbye and also my highscore is 56 , what's your ! I bet you can't beat me !
